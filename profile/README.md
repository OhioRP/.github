  A QSMP-like roleplaying server for a <a href="https://github.com/minetest/minetest"><code>minetest</code></a> based game
<p>

## Goals
- [ ] Have all Minecraft blocks just for the sake of compatibily. All the blocks must be at least craftable.
- [ ] Create a tool to convert Minecraft worlds into minetest ones. We can use [AmuletMC](https://www.amuletmc.com/) as a base.
- [ ] Have a system to live translate chat messages. This implies that we would also have a voice chat system.
- [ ] Have cool features that go beyond Minecraft's.

## Parallel Goals
- [ ] Write a wiki.
- [ ] Have shaders.
- [ ] Make Minetest's title screen better.
- [ ] Accept players that speak other languages (English, Portuguese, and Spanish).

If we can't implement something using Minetest's Lua API, we're going to fork the engine to implement those features.

  A QSMP-like roleplaying server for a <a href="https://github.com/minetest/minetest"><code>minetest</code></a> based game
<p>
Like QSMP, we plan to invite players that speak other languages (English, Portuguese, and Spanish).

## Goals
- [x] Implement a custom game with a customized minetest engine ([OhioCraft](https://github.com/OhioRP/OhioCraft) + [OhioTest](https://github.com/OhioRP/OhioTest))
- [x] Have cool features that go beyond Minecraft's.
- [ ] Make Minetest's title screen better.
- [ ] Have shaders.
- [ ] Create a tool to convert Minecraft worlds into minetest ones. We can use [AmuletMC](https://www.amuletmc.com/) as a base.
- [ ] Write a wiki.
